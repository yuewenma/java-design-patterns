What is this design pattern?
The Iterator Pattern allows traversal of the elements of an collection without
 exposing the underlying implementation

When would you use it?
Iterate a container and hide data structure from user
Support Generics container

What are the advantages of using it?
Hide data structure from user
if requirement changed its easy to change
Support Generics container

Do you see any disadvantages of the design pattern?
the abstract design is complex

In the lecture, we coded up the BinaryTree that made use of the iterator design pattern.
